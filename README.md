# The Movie Lot Theme

A child theme created for The Movie Lot website based on Astra while on internship at Lonely Alien.

This child theme has a focus on WooCommerce modifications, particular to make your E-Commerce store into a Request Quote Store with possible order checkout, but without the mentioning of any prices for the actual client.
